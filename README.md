# Gourmet Models

## Overview
The [Gourmet](https://gourmet-project.eu) has released several machine translation models to translate low-resource languages. This repository
contains information about the models, as well as sample code showing how the models can be used. The models themselves are available as dockers, and
can be downloaded from a separate site (see below).


## Using the Models
