# Gourmet Models

## Overview
The [Gourmet](https://gourmet-project.eu) has released several machine translation models to translate low-resource languages. This repository
contains information about the models, as well as sample code showing how the models can be used. The models themselves are available as dockers, downloadedable from a separate site, but links to the models can be found in `models/' , in this repository.
